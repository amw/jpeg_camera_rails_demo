# JpegCamera demo Rails app

This is a demo app showing how to use [JpegCamera](https://github.com/amw/jpeg_camera)
inside a Rails app. This repository will always contain exactly two commits. The first one
setting up a fresh Rails app and the second adding JpegCamera integration that mimics
functionality of [JpegCamera demo page](https://amw.github.io/jpeg_camera/demo/).
